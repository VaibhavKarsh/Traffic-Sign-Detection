# Traffic Sign Detection

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based traffic sign detection system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. The goal is to accurately identify and classify traffic signs in real-world images, making it suitable for applications in autonomous driving, road safety analysis, and intelligent transportation systems.

## Features
- Utilizes YOLOv8 for object detection.
- Preprocesses  images robustly for efficient classification.
- Optimized for performance in Kaggle with GPU acceleration.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VaibhavKarsh/Traffic-Sign-Detection.git
   cd Traffic-Sign-Detection
   ```

## Dataset
This project uses GTRSB dataset. Ensure that the dataset is transformed to  YOLO format with annotated bounding boxes.
